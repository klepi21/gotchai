# GotchAI: The Shield 🛡️

This is the user interface for **GotchAI**—designed to feel less like a "legal tool" and more like a premium financial instrument for your protection. Think "Revolut for Contracts."

## ✨ Why the Experience Matters
Legal documents are designed to be intimidating. We built this interface to take that power back.

- **Glassmorphism UI**: High-tech, transparent design that reflects our mission of "X-Ray vision."
- **Live Intelligence Dashboard**: Real-time stats that show you what we're auditing and how we're protecting you in the moment.
- **Visual Heatmaps**: We don't just tell you there's a trap; we highlight it in red directly on your contract so you can see exactly where they're trying to hide the fine print.
- **Legalese-to-English**: We translate complex legal jargon into simple, "5th grader" English so you actually understand your risks.
- **The "Fight Back" Button**: Instantly generate a firm negotiation email. We give you the words to stand your ground.

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind the Shield
- **Engine**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Aesthetic**: TailwindCSS + Custom Glass Utilities
- **Motion**: Framer Motion for smooth, reassuring transitions
- **Interaction**: Lucide React + Shadcn/UI

## 🚀 Launch the Shield
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The interface will automatically connect to the **Forensic Lab** (Backend) at `http://localhost:8005`.
Ensure your lab is running before you start an audit!
