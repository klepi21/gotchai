## 🛑 The Problem: You're Signing a Contract You Didn't Read.
Corporations hire armies of lawyers to hide "Zombie Fees," mandatory arbitration clauses, and predatory cancellation loops in walls of dense text. **You shouldn't need a law degree to buy a gym membership or rent an apartment.**

## 🛡️ The Solution: GotchAI.
GotchAI is an AI-powered forensic auditor that deconstructs legal contracts in seconds. It doesn't just summarize; it gives you the **X-Ray vision** to see what they're hiding and the **weapons** to negotiate a better deal.

## ⚡ The "Zero-Trust" Lab
We didn't just build a wrapper; we built a specialized laboratory for legal truth.

| Component | Our Choice | Why It Matters to You |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Brain** | **Grok 4.1 Fast** | An adversarial model that assumes the contract is hiding something. It's skeptical by design. |
| **The Speed** | **FastAPI + xAI** | Sub-second analysis. Because you need answers *before* you sign, not tomorrow. |
| **The Trust** | **Opik** | We verify our results. A 93.3% accuracy rate means you can trust our "X-Ray." |
| **The Vision** | **Hybrid OCR** | Even if it's a blurry photo of a lease, we find the precise text that puts you at risk. |

## 🏆 Proof of Performance (Verified 93.3%)
Most AI projects "vibe check" their results. We **benchmark** ours.
We maintain the `Golden-Traps-v2` dataset: 30 of the most dangerous predatory clauses currently used by major banks, service providers, and landlords.

- **Current Accuracy:** 93.3% (28/30 traps caught)
- **Verified by:** Opik Evaluation Suite
- **Mission:** We won't stop until we hit 100%.

> *"Opik helped us realize our AI was initially 'too nice.' We tuned it to be an aggressive consumer advocate, jumping our detection rate from 40% to 93%."*

## 🛠️ Peek Under the Hood

### 1. Ingestion (The Vision)
We don't just extract text; we map it. Our engine finds the literal coordinates of dangerous clauses so we can highlight them directly on your original document.

### 2. Audit (The Brain)
Using **Grok 4.1**, we run a "Zero-Trust" audit. The AI looks for liability shifts, unilateral price hikes, and friction traps designed to keep you paying.

### 3. Fight Back (The Action)
Found a trap? One click generates a firm, legally-grounded negotiation email. We give you the script to say "No" effectively.
