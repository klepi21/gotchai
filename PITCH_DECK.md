# GotchAI: The Pitch (Talk to Your Friends Version) 🗣️

*Read this like you're explaining the app to a friend at a coffee shop. No corporate speak. Just real talk.*

---

## The Intro (15 seconds)
"Hey, so you know how every time you sign up for something—a gym, a lease, an app—there's that massive wall of text nobody reads? Yeah, I built something that reads it for you. It's called GotchAI."

---

## The Problem (20 seconds)
"Here's the thing: those contracts are designed to confuse you. They hide fees in weird places, they make it almost impossible to cancel, and half of them have clauses saying you can't even sue them if something goes wrong. It's wild. And the average person doesn't have time or money to hire a lawyer just to sign up for Netflix."

---

## The Solution (30 seconds)
"So I made GotchAI. You literally just drop in a contract—a PDF, a photo, whatever—and in less than a second, it tells you exactly what's wrong with it. Not just 'this is bad,' but *why* it's bad, in plain English. Like, 'Hey, this clause means they can charge you extra fees without telling you.' Stuff like that."

## The Cool Tech Part (30 seconds)
"Under the hood, I'm using Grok—that's xAI's fast model—but I didn't just plug it in. I basically trained it to be paranoid. It doesn't assume the contract is fair; it assumes the contract is working against you. That's the whole mindset. And then I use this tool called Opik to double-check everything. So if the AI hallucinates or makes something up, we catch it."

---

## The Action Part (20 seconds)
"But here's the best part: you don't just get a report. You get a 'Fight Back' button. If there's a bad clause, you click it, and the app writes you a legal email to dispute it or opt out. Like, instantly. You go from 'I have no idea what this means' to 'Here's my formal objection' in ten seconds."

---

## The Close (15 seconds)
"That's basically it. I built GotchAI because I was tired of feeling dumb every time I signed something. Now I just drop it in, see the traps, and fight back if I need to. It's like having a lawyer in your pocket, but free and way faster."

## 💡 Tips for Recording:
- **Be yourself.** If you mess up, just restart the sentence. It'll feel more natural.
- **Show the demo.** When you say "drop in a contract," actually do it on screen. Let them see the 800ms magic.
- **Smile.** You're proud of this thing. Let that show.
