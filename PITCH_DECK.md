# GotchAI: The 3-Minute Video Pitch Script 🎬

*This script is timed for a high-impact, 3-minute video entry. Follow the **[VISUAL CUE]** instructions to match what the judges see with what you say.*

## 0:00 - The Hook (15s)
**[VISUAL CUE: Face Camera / Split Screen with Blurry Contract]**
"Hi, I’m Dinos. Like you, I click 'Agree' on 12 contracts a month without reading a word. Why? Because it takes 45 minutes to decode the fine print. We aren't just clicking a button; we're waiving our rights. Corporations bank on our exhaustion. I built GotchAI to stop them."

---

## 0:15 - The Solution (30s)
**[VISUAL CUE: Screen Record - Drag & Drop PDF -> Instant Analysis]**
"This is GotchAI. Financial X-Ray Vision. Watch this."
*(Pause for 2 seconds as the analysis completes in 800ms)*
"In under a second, we didn't just summarize the document; we audited it. We found the hidden fees, the frictionless traps, and the liability drifts that threaten your wallet."

## 0:45 - The Architecture: "The Forensic Lab" (60s)
**[VISUAL CUE: Diagram - Contract -> Brain -> Verification -> Shield]**
"We didn't just build a wrapper; we built a Forensic Laboratory. Here’s how it works:"

1.  **The Vision (OCR)**: "First, our **Hybrid OCR Engine** scans the document—even if it's a blurry photo—and maps the exact XY coordinates of every word."
2.  **The Brain (Grok 4.1)**: "Next, **Grok 4.1 Fast** analyzes the text. But here's the secret: we don't use a helpful assistant persona. We act as an **Adversarial Forensic Auditor**. It *expects* the contract to be predatory."
3.  **The Verification (Opik)**: "We don't trust the AI blindly. We use **Opik** to trace every run against our 'Golden Set' of known traps. If the AI hallucinates, we catch it."
4.  **The Score**: "Finally, we apply a **Deterministic Scoring Formula**. Critical risks are weighted 3x higher than minor cautions. A '90/100' isn't a guess; it's a mathematical certainty."

## 1:45 - The "Fight Back" Demo (45s)
**[VISUAL CUE: Click "Fight This" Button -> Show Email Generation in Modal]**
"But knowledge is useless without action. When GotchAI finds a trap—like this 'Mandatory Arbitration' clause—I just click **Fight This**."
*(Show the email generation)*
"Instantly, I have a legally grounded negotiation script. I go from 'Victim' to 'Negotiator' in one click."

---

## 2:30 - The Vision & Close (30s)
**[VISUAL CUE: Dinos Face Camera / Scrolling Dashboard Background]**
"We solved Speed with Grok 4.1. We solved Trust with Opik. And now, we're solving the power imbalance between people and corporations.
I'm Dinos, and this is GotchAI. Let's make the fine print transparent."

## 💡 Production Tips for the 3m Video:
- **Don't Read**: Verify the points, but speak naturally.
- **Speed Matters**: The 800ms analysis is your "Magic Trick." Make sure that part of the screen recording is snappy.
- **Audio**: Ensure your voice is clear. The music should be subtle background, building slightly at the "Fight Back" section.
